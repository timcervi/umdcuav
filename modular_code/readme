This is the CUAV code split into different modules for ease of reading and editing. 
Right now only the servo loop is implemented as proof of concept, the rest will be added shortly.

Note: startup.py has 'from builtins import input'    this allows the input function used to be compatible with python 2 and 3.
You will need to 'sudo pip install future'. (this installs builtins)
